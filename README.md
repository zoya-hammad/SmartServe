# SmartServe
This repository contains the files for my third-semester project â€“ Smart Serve: Integrated Cafeteria Management.

This desktop app aims to provide user and admin functionality for a cafeteria application designed to digitalize meal ordering and payment. Users can purchase meals based on existing meal plans or via student cards, view menus, apply advanced filtering, and receive transactional history. A unique QR code is generated for each transaction, which users can easily capture and present at the counter as an e-receipt for order fulfillment. Admin functionalities include user management, creation, and modification of meal plans, adding cash to student cards, menu item management, and access to user transaction history. The login system uses a sha-256 hashing system for enhanced security. All relevant data is efficiently managed using a MySQL database for ease of access. The application contains a user-friendly, multiple-document graphical user interface developed using QT Creator and framework in C++ programming language.
